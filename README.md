# microworldB

Environment created by Dr. Zachary Hutchinson.
AI navigation code  (aiA.py, aiB.py) created by Joe Binette.

The AIs navigate through unknown spaces by mapping out what they see, and making decisions based on what they have seen. They collect keys that award bonus points, and prioritize searching spaces that will reveal even more of the world. When one of them sees an exit, it will escape, but the other will continue exploring until time is almost up.

Worlds are divided up into spaces that are completely isolated, aside from access using portals. Spaces are completely explored before portals are used.
